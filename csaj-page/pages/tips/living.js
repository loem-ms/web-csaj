                        Learn the language: Japanese is the official language of Japan and it would be very helpful for you to have a basic understanding of the language, as it will make it much easier for you to communicate with the locals and get around the country.
                        Even if you do not become fluent, it is important to learn some basic phrases such as "hello," "thank you," and "excuse me."
                        This will show respect for the culture and will make it easier for you to form relationships with the people you meet.
