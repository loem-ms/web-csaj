Interviewer: Great! Let's start with the basics. What's it like to study science-related fields in a Japanese university?

ChatGPT: Japan is known for its strong emphasis on science and technology, and this is reflected in the quality of its universities. Studying science-related fields in a Japanese university can be rigorous, but also incredibly rewarding. The focus is often on hands-on learning, with opportunities for internships and research projects.
